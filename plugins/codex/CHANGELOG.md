# Changelog

## 1.1.0-fh.1

- Add local marketplace extension notice while preserving OpenAI attribution.
- Prepare Codex-native maturity improvements for release checks, diagnostics, capacity governance, hardened jobs, preview CI workflow rendering, multi-role review, quality presets, and safer stop gates.
- Breaking: `/codex:task`, `/codex:review`, and `/codex:adversarial-review` now reject unknown flag-like tokens before the first positional; use `--` before prompt/focus text that intentionally starts with `-` or `--`.
- Known limitation: background-job lease cleanup is daemonless and can temporarily treat a quickly reused dead pid as alive until later job-state or lease expiry evidence corrects it.
- Note: this changelog entry covers only the local extension work in this release and does not invent historical notes for earlier bundled versions.

## 1.0.0

- Initial version of the Codex plugin for Claude Code
